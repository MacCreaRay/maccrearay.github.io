    <h1>About MacCreaRay</h1>
    <p>I’m a tech enthusiast who combines a hands-on approach with a passion for thorough research. My career began in automotive manufacturing for Ford Motor Company, where I quickly advanced from machine operator to Quality Assurance, driven by my attention to detail. To expand my skillset, I pursued night courses in Electronics and Quality Control, which led to servicing coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) across North America and gaining expertise in various programming languages and systems.

      After a brief apprenticeship as an Industrial Electrician, I joined IMAX as a Service Engineer, supporting theatres globally. While this role provided incredible experience, I sought more time with family and returned to school, studying Computer Networking at Mohawk College. Following several contract roles, I took the opportunity during COVID to earn my private pilot’s license and launch my own IT business.
      
      Now, I’m excited to pivot into Web Development, ready to adapt and grow with today’s economic challenges.
